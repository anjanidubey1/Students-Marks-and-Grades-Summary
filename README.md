# Student Marks Analyzer and Grade Summary System

## Project Description

This Python project is designed to take input of marks obtained by multiple students in three subjects and generate a summary report showing each studentâ€™s total marks, average, and grade. The program also calculates the class average and identifies the topper among all students.

This project is ideal for beginners who want to understand how to apply basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, list manipulation, dictionaries, and formatted output in Python.

## Features

- Accepts student names and marks for 3 subjects
- Calculates:
  - Total and average marks per student
  - Grade based on average marks
  - Class average
  - Topper of the class
- Clean, console-based interface for input and output
- Modular and beginner-friendly code

## Input

- Number of students (integer)
- Student name (string)
- Marks for 3 subjects per student (integers)

### Example Input:
Enter number of students: 2
